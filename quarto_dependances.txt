DEPENDENCY MANUAL AND TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

PROJECT: Meteo Analysis (France Climate)

1. CONCEPT: PURPOSE OF TOOLS

This project constitutes a complete data application.
Quarto acts as the orchestrator, assembling analyses (Python) and text to generate the final website. It performs no direct calculations but delegates these operations to the Python environment detailed below.

2. SYSTEM DEPENDENCIES (FOUNDATIONS)


* DVC (Data Version Control)
  - General Role: Versioning large files not managed by Git.
  - PROJECT CONTEXT: Management of voluminous NetCDF files (`era5_t2m_*.nc`) and the shapefiles directory (`masque_simplemaps/`). Enables population of the `data/` directory upon startup.
  - Linked File: `daaata.dvc`

* Quarto CLI
  - General Role: Compiling code and text into HTML.
  - PROJECT CONTEXT: Transformation of the `transfert_quarto.qmd` file into an interactive web dashboard.

3. PYTHON DEPENDENCIES (THE ENGINE)

These libraries constitute the core of the system and must appear in the `requirements.txt` file.

A. The Bridge to Quarto
* jupyter & ipykernel
  - Role: Enabling communication between Quarto and Python.
  - PROJECT CONTEXT: Indispensable for the execution of `{python}` code blocks present in `transfert_quarto.qmd`.

B. Web Interactivity
* shiny
  - Role: Creation of interactive sliders and menus.
  - PROJECT CONTEXT: Utilization within the dashboard to allow changing the displayed year or region without reloading the page.

C. Data Acquisition
* cdsapi
  - Role: Client for the Copernicus Climate Data Store API.
  - PROJECT CONTEXT: Utilization by the script `loic/download.py` for downloading ERA5 reanalysis data (2m Temperature).

D. Data Processing
* xarray
  - Role: Manipulation of multidimensional data cubes (Labelled Data Arrays).
  - PROJECT CONTEXT: Primary library used in `plot_temp.ipynb` for opening `.nc` files and selecting dimensions (latitude, longitude, time).

* netCDF4
  - Role: File reading driver.
  - PROJECT CONTEXT: Mandatory dependency (though invisible) for the opening of `test_era5_t2m_*.nc` files by xarray.

* pandas
  - Role: Manipulation of classic tabular data.
  - PROJECT CONTEXT: Utilization for manipulating time series after calculation of spatial means (e.g., CSV `reanalysis-era5-land...csv`).

E. Geography and Visualization
* geopandas
  - Role: Manipulation of geometric data.
  - PROJECT CONTEXT: Utilization for reading shapefiles (`masque_simplemaps/*.shp`) and clipping the map of France.

* shapely
  - Role: Geometric calculation engine.
  - PROJECT CONTEXT: Execution of intersection operations (e.g., determining if a pixel belongs to a given region) used in the notebooks.

* matplotlib
  - Role: Creation of charts and plots.
  - PROJECT CONTEXT: Generation of temperature heatmaps displayed in the report.

4. JULIA DEPENDENCIES (ACCELERATOR - OPTIONAL)

Note: These tools serve solely for data *preparation*, not for site display.

* Shapefile.jl & PolygonOps.jl
  - PROJECT CONTEXT: Replacement of Geopandas for the mask creation step (rasterization). Accelerated processing of files in the `masque_simplemaps` directory for generating `.nc` weight files.
